# Project Brief: AI Discovery Wizard

---

## Executive Summary

**AI Discovery Wizard** is a web-based interactive tool that guides business owners through a personalized discovery process to explore AI and LLM automation opportunities for their workflows. In just 10-15 minutes (or 5 minutes on mobile), the wizard uses intelligent, conversational AI to identify specific automation possibilities, provides real-time cost estimates, calculates time savings, and generates a professional summary document—serving simultaneously as a lead qualification tool for vendors and an educational experience that demonstrates AI's value to potential clients.

**Innovative UX Approach:** The wizard pioneers a "next-level familiar" interaction pattern—combining dynamic AI-generated form elements with transparent contextual insights (showing relevant business analysis like "5 paralegals × 2hrs/day intake = 50hrs/week automation opportunity" rather than generic loading messages) and a visual workflow sketcher where users refine AI-suggested automation packages in real-time. This approach pushes beyond traditional web forms while maintaining intuitive usability.

**Target Market:** Small to medium business owners (5-50 employees) in professional services sectors (legal, healthcare, real estate, consulting) exploring AI adoption to optimize workflows and scale operations without proportional hiring costs.

**Key Value Proposition:** Unlike traditional "contact us for a quote" approaches that require lengthy sales calls, this wizard provides immediate, transparent pricing and personalized automation recommendations while the discovery experience itself proves AI's capability through flawless execution—converting the sales process into a product demonstration that reinforces the value of AI adoption. Users leave with actionable insights regardless of whether they book a consultation, building trust through value-first engagement.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**

Business owners in professional services sectors face a critical bottleneck: manual, repetitive workflows consume disproportionate staff time, limiting their ability to scale operations or accept increased workload. Small law firms spend hours on contract reviews, client intake, and document generation. Healthcare practices drown in administrative paperwork. Real estate agencies manually process transaction documents. While these businesses recognize AI and LLM technology could automate many workflows, they encounter significant friction in the discovery and purchasing process:

1. **Information Asymmetry:** No transparent way to understand what AI can actually do for their specific workflows without engaging in lengthy sales processes
2. **Pricing Opacity:** AI/LLM costs are unclear, requiring vendor quotes and technical discussions before getting ballpark figures
3. **Time-Intensive Discovery:** Traditional software sales require 1-2 hour calls, multiple follow-ups, and significant time investment before learning if solutions are feasible or affordable
4. **Analysis Paralysis:** Too many AI providers, unclear differentiation, and technical jargon create decision paralysis
5. **Trust Deficit:** Skepticism about AI reliability and concern about implementation complexity prevent exploration

**Impact & Quantification:**

- **Vendor Side:** High customer acquisition costs due to unqualified leads, wasted discovery calls with mismatched prospects, and long sales cycles (average 30-90 days for custom software)
- **Client Side:** Businesses delay or abandon AI adoption due to discovery friction, missing significant productivity gains. Studies show routine administrative tasks (document drafting, data entry, email responses, research) consume 15-30% of professional services staff time—work that AI/LLM tools can automate or accelerate. Companies continue scaling linearly through hiring rather than exponentially through automation, leading to compressed margins and slower growth.
- **Market Inefficiency:** Qualified buyers struggle to find right solutions; qualified vendors struggle to reach right buyers efficiently

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

- **Contact Forms:** Require waiting for sales team response, no immediate value, purely vendor-serving
- **Static Pricing Pages:** Can't account for business-specific variables, force prospects into ill-fitting tiers
- **Chatbots:** Generic, unable to provide meaningful cost estimates or detailed discovery
- **Spreadsheet Calculators:** Require technical knowledge to use, don't guide discovery process

**Urgency:**

AI adoption is accelerating rapidly. Businesses that don't explore automation in 2025 risk competitive disadvantage as peers achieve significant productivity gains through AI-assisted workflows. The market needs a frictionless discovery mechanism that serves both buyers (education + transparency) and vendors (qualified pipeline + reduced CAC) immediately.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:**

The AI Discovery Wizard transforms software discovery from a vendor-gated, time-intensive process into an immediate, self-service experience that educates while qualifying. Rather than forcing prospects through contact forms and sales calls to learn "what's possible" and "what it costs," we reverse the flow: the AI proactively suggests relevant automation opportunities based on a few context questions, displays real-time pricing, and allows users to interactively refine their automation package—all within 10-15 minutes.

**How It Works:**

1. **Intelligent Entry:** User clicks "Check if AI can be useful for me" and begins a conversational discovery flow
2. **Adaptive Questioning:** AI asks general questions (industry, team size, pain points) then progressively more specific ones based on responses, maintaining natural conversation flow
3. **AI-First Suggestions:** After gathering sufficient context, AI proposes a package of relevant automations (e.g., "Contract review assistant," "Client intake automation," "Document generation") displayed in a visual workflow sketcher
4. **Interactive Refinement:** User adds, removes, or modifies suggested automations; pricing updates in real-time alongside time savings calculations
5. **Transparent Intelligence:** Throughout the process, AI shows its contextual reasoning (e.g., "5 paralegals spending 2hrs/day on intake = 50hrs/week opportunity") rather than generic loading states
6. **Professional Output:** User receives comprehensive PDF report (problems identified → solutions proposed → costs estimated → time saved) suitable for sharing with stakeholders
7. **Frictionless Conversion:** Option to immediately book consultation with pre-filled agenda, or receive PDF via email for later consideration (lead capture + nurture sequence)

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Proof Through Experience:** The wizard itself demonstrates AI capability—if the discovery experience is intelligent and valuable, it reinforces the user's confidence in AI adoption
2. **Reverse Discovery:** AI suggests first (educated recommendations) rather than blank-slate questioning—faster and more educational
3. **Next-Level Familiar UX:** Combines conversational AI intelligence with familiar form-based interactions, pushing boundaries while remaining intuitive
4. **Radical Transparency:** Shows AI reasoning, displays pricing, no gatekeeping information behind sales calls
5. **Dual Value Creation:** Client gets immediate actionable insights; vendor gets structured discovery document and qualified pipeline

**Why This Succeeds Where Others Haven't:**

- **Trust Building:** Providing value first (free insights, transparent pricing) rather than extracting information (lead forms) builds reciprocity
- **Time Efficiency:** 10-15 minutes vs. 1-2 hour sales calls dramatically lowers exploration barrier
- **Educational Approach:** Users learn what's possible during discovery, reducing implementation anxiety
- **Technical Innovation:** "Next-level familiar" UX creates memorable differentiation in commoditized software sales market

**High-Level Vision:**

Launch as lead generation tool (MVP), evolve into comprehensive requirements management platform that continues supporting stakeholder alignment and change management throughout project delivery. The same conversational AI that qualifies leads becomes the system of record for implementation.

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Minimal upfront investment; targeting <$100/month operational costs during MVP phase (hosting, APIs, services). Development costs via founder time or contract developers (budget TBD based on team composition).

- **Timeline:** Target 6-8 weeks for MVP development from project kickoff to launch. Assumes focused development effort (1-2 developers full-time or 2-3 part-time). First user sessions within 2 months.

- **Resources:**
  - Development: 1-2 developers (full-stack or frontend + backend split)
  - Design: UI/UX design resources (contractor or founder-led with design tools)
  - Content: Industry knowledge base and automation templates (founder expertise)
  - No dedicated QA initially (developer-led testing + beta user feedback)

- **Technical:**
  - Must use cost-effective infrastructure (serverless, low fixed costs)
  - Single LLM provider for MVP (multi-provider deferred to V2)
  - Web-only (no native mobile apps)
  - English language only initially
  - Limited to 5-10 concurrent sessions initially (no high-scale infrastructure)

---

### Key Assumptions

- **User Behavior:** Business owners will invest 10-15 minutes for valuable insights without requiring human interaction first. Self-service discovery is preferred over gated sales processes.

- **AI Capability:** Single generalist LLM agent can provide relevant, industry-specific automation recommendations across multiple professional services verticals without specialized fine-tuning.

- **Pricing Transparency:** Showing transparent cost estimates (including margin) will increase trust and conversion rather than scare away prospects. Users value honesty over obfuscation.

- **Discovery Quality:** Conversational AI can extract sufficient context in 10-15 minutes to generate actionable discovery documents comparable to 60-minute sales calls.

- **Market Readiness:** Target audience (small business owners in professional services) has sufficient AI awareness and interest in 2025 to actively seek automation solutions.

- **Value Proposition:** Providing free, immediate value (insights + pricing) creates stronger conversion pipeline than traditional lead capture forms, despite "giving away" the discovery process.

- **Technical Feasibility:** Visual workflow sketcher and dynamic form generation can be built within budget/timeline constraints without custom design system or complex state management.

- **Lead Quality:** Self-qualified leads who complete wizard will have higher intent and better budget fit than cold outreach leads, justifying the investment in building the tool.

- **Competitive Advantage:** "Next-level familiar" UX will be differentiated enough to generate word-of-mouth and social sharing, reducing paid acquisition costs.

- **Founder Bandwidth:** Founder can personally handle 15-25 booked consultations per month (from 100 wizard completions) without overwhelming operational capacity during MVP phase.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **AI Quality Risk:** AI fails to provide relevant automation recommendations, feels generic or off-target. Users perceive tool as gimmicky rather than intelligent, damaging brand credibility and reinforcing AI skepticism.
  - _Impact: High—undermines core value proposition_
  - _Mitigation: Extensive prompt engineering, industry knowledge base development, beta testing with 10-15 target users before public launch_

- **Completion Rate Risk:** Users abandon wizard mid-flow due to length, complexity, or unclear value proposition. 60% completion target proves unrealistic.
  - _Impact: High—low completion = wasted traffic/marketing spend_
  - _Mitigation: Progressive value disclosure (show insights early), clear progress indicators, ability to save and return, aggressive UX testing_

- **Pricing Transparency Backfire:** Showing costs upfront scares prospects away rather than building trust. Traditional "contact us" might actually convert better.
  - _Impact: Medium—challenges core thesis but learnable_
  - _Mitigation: A/B test with/without pricing display, offer pricing ranges instead of exact figures, emphasize ROI alongside cost_

- **Technical Complexity Underestimation:** Visual workflow sketcher, mobile-desktop handoff, or PDF generation proves more complex than estimated, causing timeline/budget overruns.
  - _Impact: Medium—delays launch but doesn't kill project_
  - _Mitigation: Technical spike/prototype for high-risk components before committing to full build, identify fallback simpler UX patterns_

- **Lead Quality Mismatch:** Self-qualified leads have lower close rates than expected. Users complete wizard out of curiosity, not genuine intent.
  - _Impact: Medium—affects ROI but volume may compensate_
  - _Mitigation: Add qualification questions ("What's your timeline?"), track lead source quality metrics, iterate on filtering_

- **Founder Bandwidth Constraint:** Call volume exceeds capacity (>25/month), causing delays in response times and poor prospect experience.
  - _Impact: Low initially, high if successful_
  - _Mitigation: Set clear expectations on response time, hire sales support at 20+ calls/month, automate more of follow-up process_

- **Competitive Response:** Existing AI consultancies or software vendors quickly copy approach once launched, eroding first-mover advantage.
  - _Impact: Medium—inevitable but timing matters_
  - _Mitigation: Build brand recognition quickly, focus on execution quality (hard to copy), file provisional patent if truly novel UX patterns emerge_

---

### Open Questions

- **Which LLM provider offers best cost/quality trade-off for conversational discovery?** Need to benchmark GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro with sample conversations and evaluate relevance + cost.

- **What's the optimal question sequence?** How many questions are too few (insufficient context) vs. too many (abandonment)? Requires user testing to find balance.

- **How specific should automation suggestions be?** High-level ("Contract review assistant") vs. detailed ("Extract key dates, flag non-standard clauses, generate summary briefs")? Does detail build confidence or overwhelm?

- **Should mobile users be actively encouraged to continue on desktop?** Or should 5-min mobile flow be genuinely valuable standalone to avoid frustration?

- **What lead scoring criteria matter most?** Budget indicators, timeline urgency, technical readiness, team size? Need to correlate wizard data with actual close rates.

- **How much industry knowledge is "enough"?** Can we launch with 3-4 verticals well-covered, or do we need 10+ to avoid appearing niche?

- **What's the right balance between AI flexibility and structured outputs?** Pure conversational flow risks inconsistency; pure form feels robotic. Where's the sweet spot?

- **Should we charge for the wizard experience itself?** (Freemium model: basic free, detailed report $29-49?) Or keep fully free to maximize top-of-funnel?

---

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **Competitive landscape audit:** Identify existing AI discovery tools, pricing calculators, or wizard-style sales tools in adjacent markets. What can we learn/avoid?

- **User interview validation:** Talk to 5-10 target users about current discovery pain points, willingness to self-serve, pricing transparency preferences, time commitments.

- **Token cost modeling:** Build spreadsheet projecting LLM costs at different session volumes (10/day, 50/day, 100/day) across providers to validate <$100/month assumption.

- **Workflow sketcher UX patterns:** Research existing visual workflow tools (Zapier, n8n, Miro) to understand proven interaction patterns before building custom component.

- **PDF report benchmarking:** Analyze professional reports from consultancies, mortgage pre-approvals, health assessments to identify design patterns that convey credibility.

- **Legal/compliance review:** Confirm no regulatory issues with providing cost estimates, storing minimal PII, or representing capabilities of AI solutions (especially in healthcare/legal verticals).

- **Calendar integration options:** Evaluate Cal.com vs. Calendly vs. custom build for features, costs, and user experience quality.
