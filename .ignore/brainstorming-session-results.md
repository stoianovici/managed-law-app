### SCAMPER Method - 20 minutes

**Description:** Systematic exploration through 7 lenses (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse)

**Ideas Generated:**

**S = SUBSTITUTE**

1. Replace static pricing tiers → AI/user monthly cost estimation (separate custom dev discussion)
2. Replace manual interpretation → AI summary with client confirmation + technical translation
3. Replace email follow-up → Short video testimonials from existing clients (social proof)
4. Replace pure form → Interactive workflow sketcher (AI suggests, client edits visually)

**C = COMBINE** 5. Discovery + pricing happen simultaneously, update in real-time as features added/removed 6. Focus on clean, singular purpose (no feature creep)

**A = ADAPT** 7. Don't borrow from old industries - create "next-level familiar" experience 8. Evolutionary, not derivative - push boundaries while staying intuitive

**M = MODIFY** 9. Desktop-first UI (stays in viewport, no scroll overload) 10. Mobile = 5min lite version with desktop continuation option 11. User selects time commitment upfront (10, 15, 30 min) 12. AI closes session early if all info gathered (respect user time) 13. Transparency on time investment before starting

**P = PUT TO OTHER USES** 14. V1 = Lead generation tool 15. V2 Evolution = Requirements management platform during implementation 16. Same conversational AI becomes system of record for delivery 17. Stakeholder alignment + change management built-in

**E = ELIMINATE** 18. No sales jargon or corporate speak (conversational, human) 19. No email required until end (anonymous exploration) 20. Auto-save + auto-progress (no submit buttons, seamless flow)

**R = REVERSE / REARRANGE** 21. AI proposes automation package first (based on initial questions) 22. Client refines by adding/removing (vs. starting from blank slate) 23. Educates users on possibilities they didn't know to ask for 24. Faster and more comprehensive discovery

**Insights Discovered:**

- Reversing discovery flow (AI suggests first) is more efficient and educational
- Eliminating friction points (no email gate, auto-progress) reduces abandonment
- Time-adaptive sessions respect user constraints while maximizing data quality
- Evolution from lead gen to project management tool creates long-term product value

**Notable Connections:**

- Workflow sketcher (substitute) + AI suggests first (reverse) = powerful combination
- Time adaptation (modify) + early closure (modify) = respectful user experience
- Video testimonials (substitute) + social proof at decision moment = conversion boost

2. Structure content sections (problems → solutions → pricing → time savings)
3. Add visual elements (charts for time savings, pricing comparison table)
4. Create internal discovery doc format (technical requirements view for vendor)
5. Build PDF generation pipeline
6. Test shareability (does it sell itself to stakeholders?)

**Resources Needed:**

- PDF generation library
- Graphic design for templates
- Content writing/formatting

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

---

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- Progressive technique flow (warm-up → divergent → structured → convergent) maintained momentum
- SCAMPER framework uncovered non-obvious opportunities (especially Reverse)
- Mind mapping organized complexity into clear branches
- "Next-level familiar" became a guiding design principle
- Dual output system (client value + vendor intelligence) emerged naturally

### Areas for Further Exploration

- **Industry-Specific Agents**: Single generalist vs. vertical specialists - needs testing
