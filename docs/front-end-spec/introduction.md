# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for **AI Discovery Wizard**'s user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Primary User: Small Business Owner in Professional Services**

- Age: 35-55, owns or manages a professional services firm (legal, healthcare, real estate, consulting)
- Pain points: Manual workflows consuming 15-30% of staff time, limited technical expertise, skeptical of AI hype
- Goals: Understand AI potential quickly, get transparent pricing, minimize risk
- Behavior: Time-constrained, wants self-service discovery, shares decisions with partners/stakeholders

**Secondary User: Operations Manager**

- Manages day-to-day workflows, identifies bottlenecks
- Tech-savvy enough to evaluate automation tools but not a developer
- Seeks concrete ROI metrics and implementation feasibility
- Decision influencer who reports findings to ownership

### Usability Goals

1. **Speed of Discovery**: New users complete core flow in 10-15 minutes (desktop) or 5 minutes (mobile)
2. **Comprehension**: Users understand automation recommendations and pricing without additional explanation
3. **Confidence Building**: Experience demonstrates AI capability, increasing trust in adoption
4. **Decision Support**: Users can evaluate ROI (cost vs. time saved) and justify decisions to stakeholders
5. **Minimal Friction**: <15% drop-off at any single step, 60%+ overall completion rate

### Design Principles

1. **Proof Through Experience**: The wizard itself demonstrates AI's intelligenceâ€”if discovery is smart and delightful, it validates the technology
2. **Transparent Intelligence**: Show AI reasoning contextually (business calculations, opportunity analysis) rather than hiding behind loading spinners
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple (basic questions), reveal complexity gradually based on engagement
4. **Immediate Value**: Provide insights early in the flow to maintain momentum and demonstrate worth before asking for commitment
5. **Trust Through Clarity**: No dark patterns, no gatekeeping information, radical transparency in pricing and capabilities
