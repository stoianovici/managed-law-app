# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Create Visual Design Mockups**: Translate wireframe specifications into high-fidelity designs in Figma (Landing Page, Question Flow, Workflow Sketcher, Summary Screen)
2. **Component Library Setup**: Initialize shadcn/ui in project, configure Tailwind theme with brand colors and typography, create custom Automation Card component
3. **Responsive Prototypes**: Build interactive prototypes for mobile and desktop workflows to validate user flows and interactions before development
4. **Accessibility Audit Plan**: Set up Axe DevTools in CI/CD pipeline, create manual testing checklist for keyboard navigation and screen readers
5. **Design System Documentation**: Document component usage guidelines, accessibility requirements, and responsive behaviors for development team
6. **Design Review with Stakeholders**: Present UX specifications and visual designs to project stakeholders for approval before development begins
