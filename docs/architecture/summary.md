# Summary

This architecture document defines a **serverless-first, fullstack Next.js application** optimized for rapid MVP development (6-8 week timeline) and cost efficiency ($20-100/month at launch). The system leverages modern technologies (Next.js 14, Supabase, Anthropic Claude) to deliver an intelligent, interactive wizard experience that converts prospects into qualified leads.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

- Next.js 14 App Router for unified fullstack development
- Supabase for all-in-one backend platform (database, storage, real-time)
- Server Actions + REST hybrid API approach
- Serverless functions for auto-scaling and cost optimization
- JSONB flexibility for rapid iteration with relational data foundation

**Technology Stack:**

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js Server Actions/API Routes, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5
- **Infrastructure:** Vercel (hosting), Supabase (backend), Cloudflare (CDN)
- **Integrations:** Resend (email), Cal.com (calendar), Plausible (analytics)

**Development Workflow:**

- Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- TypeScript strict mode everywhere
- Vitest for testing (70% unit test coverage target)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel automatic deployments

**Ready for Development:** This architecture provides a comprehensive blueprint for the development team to begin implementation immediately, with clear guidance on technology choices, patterns, and best practices.
