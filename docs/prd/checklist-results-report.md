# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness**: 95% complete

**MVP Scope Appropriateness**: Just Right - Well-balanced scope that delivers core value while maintaining 6-8 week feasibility

**Readiness for Architecture Phase**: **READY** - Comprehensive requirements, clear technical guidance, well-structured epics

**Critical Strengths**:

- Excellent problem definition backed by detailed Project Brief
- Clear differentiation (reverse discovery, transparent pricing, workflow sketcher)
- Strong technical guidance with specific recommendations (React, Node.js, Claude Sonnet, Supabase considerations)
- Comprehensive user stories with detailed acceptance criteria
- 5 sequential epics deliver incremental value from foundation to production-ready

**Minor Gaps Identified**:

- Analytics requirements distributed across stories; centralized tracking plan would help
- A/B testing strategy mentioned in Epic 5 but not detailed
- Post-launch iteration plan implicit but not formalized

## Top Recommendations (Enhancements, Not Blockers)

**MEDIUM Priority**:

1. **Centralized Analytics Plan**: Create a single reference document listing all tracked events, conversion funnels, and dashboard requirements (currently distributed across 25 stories)
2. **A/B Testing Strategy**: Define specific hypotheses to test (e.g., pricing visibility, CTA copy, mobile flow length) with success criteria
3. **Post-MVP Roadmap**: Formalize phase 2 priorities based on MVP learnings (currently implied but not explicit)

**LOW Priority**: 4. **Wireframes/Mockups**: Visual designs would help align team on "next-level familiar" aesthetic (not required for architecture phase but valuable for development) 5. **Competitive Analysis**: Brief analysis of similar tools (mortgage calculators, configurators, chatbots) to validate differentiation (mentioned in Project Brief but not detailed)

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Appropriate Scope**: ✅

- 5 epics × 5 stories = 25 total stories
- ~1.5-2 weeks per epic = 7.5-10 weeks total (within 6-8 week target with parallelization or scope tuning)
- Each epic delivers deployable value
- Complexity distributed evenly across epics

**No Features to Cut**: Core experience requires all defined features for value proposition

- Cannot cut AI (differentiator), pricing (transparency promise), workflow sketcher (UX innovation), PDF/booking (conversion)
- Mobile experience (Epic 5) could be deferred if timeline pressure, but highly valuable for target market

**Timeline Realism**: Achievable with 2 full-stack developers or 1 FTE + founder contributions

- Epic 1-2: Heavy lift (infrastructure + AI) - 3-4 weeks
- Epic 3-4: Moderate (UX + integrations) - 3-4 weeks
- Epic 5: Polish + testing - 1.5-2 weeks
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize Epic 1-4 for core MVP, Epic 5 as "launch quality" phase (can soft-launch after Epic 4 if needed)

## Technical Readiness

**Technical Clarity**: Excellent - Architect has clear direction

- Stack recommendation: React + TypeScript, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, Supabase consideration
- Hosting: Vercel/Netlify frontend, Railway/Render backend
- LLM: Claude Sonnet leading candidate (requires benchmarking in Epic 2)
- Integrations: Cal.com/Calendly, Resend/SendGrid, Puppeteer, Plausible

**Identified Technical Risks**:

1. **Workflow Sketcher Complexity**: Most novel UX component, may require iteration (mitigated by Epic 3 focus)
2. **LLM Cost Control**: Token usage could exceed $100/month budget at scale (mitigated by rate limiting, monitoring)
3. **PDF Generation Performance**: 5-second target may be tight with Puppeteer (consider React-PDF alternative)
4. **Mobile-Desktop Handoff**: Session continuation adds complexity (Epic 5, deferrable if needed)

**Areas for Architect Investigation**:

- Next.js (SSR) vs Vite (SPA) decision based on SEO priority
- Supabase (all-in-one) vs separate Postgres+Redis trade-offs
- LLM provider benchmarking methodology and criteria
- Workflow sketcher interaction patterns (Figma/Miro research)

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides excellent guidance for architectural design. The requirements are clear, testable, and appropriately scoped for MVP. Technical guidance balances specificity (recommended stack) with flexibility (alternatives documented). Epic structure delivers incremental value with logical sequencing.

**Next Step**: Proceed to architecture phase with /BMad/agents/architect using this PRD as input.
