# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch a web-based AI Discovery Wizard that generates 100+ qualified completions within the first 3 months, with 15-25% converting to booked consultations
- Reduce sales cycle time by 40% (from 30-90 days to 18-54 days) through automated discovery and pre-qualification
- Lower customer acquisition costs by 30% compared to traditional outbound sales methods
- Demonstrate AI capability through the wizard experience itself, increasing user confidence in AI adoption
- Provide immediate, transparent value to business owners (pricing + insights) while building a qualified sales pipeline
- Establish market position as innovative, transparent AI consultancy in professional services sectors

## Background Context

Small business owners in professional services (legal, healthcare, real estate, consulting) face a critical bottleneck: manual, repetitive workflows consume 15-30% of staff time, limiting their ability to scale operations. While these businesses recognize that AI and LLM technology could automate many workflows, they encounter significant friction in the discovery process—information asymmetry, pricing opacity, time-intensive sales calls, and trust deficits prevent exploration.

The AI Discovery Wizard transforms software discovery from a vendor-gated, time-intensive process into an immediate, self-service experience. Rather than forcing prospects through contact forms and sales calls to learn "what's possible" and "what it costs," the wizard reverses the flow: AI proactively suggests relevant automation opportunities based on contextual questions, displays real-time pricing, and allows interactive refinement—all within 10-15 minutes. The experience itself proves AI's capability, building trust through transparent value delivery while capturing qualified leads for the vendor.
