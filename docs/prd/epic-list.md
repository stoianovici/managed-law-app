# Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Wizard Flow**
Establish project infrastructure (monorepo setup, CI/CD, hosting), implement basic wizard shell (landing page, question flow, progress tracking), and create foundational services (session management, database models). Deliverable: A functional "hello world" wizard that can capture user input and persist sessions, deployable to production environment.

**Epic 2: AI Intelligence & Discovery Engine**
Integrate LLM provider (Claude/GPT-4), implement adaptive questioning logic (context gathering with branching), build AI recommendation engine that analyzes user context and proposes relevant automations. Deliverable: Wizard can conduct intelligent discovery conversations and generate tailored automation suggestions based on business context.

**Epic 3: Workflow Sketcher & Pricing System**
Build visual workflow sketcher interface (automation cards, add/remove/modify interactions), implement real-time pricing calculation engine (token estimation, cost modeling), create time savings calculator, and design persistent pricing panel. Deliverable: Users can interactively refine automation packages with immediate pricing and ROI feedback.

**Epic 4: Output Generation & Conversion**
Implement summary screen with professional output design, build PDF generation system (shareable reports), create email capture and delivery flow, integrate calendar booking (Cal.com/Calendly), and generate structured discovery documents for vendor follow-up. Deliverable: Complete end-to-end wizard experience from entry to conversion (PDF + calendar booking).

**Epic 5: Mobile Experience & Polish**
Create streamlined mobile flow (5-minute lite version), implement session continuation/handoff between devices, add contextual AI insights display throughout wizard, optimize performance (loading times, animations), and conduct beta user testing with refinements. Deliverable: Production-ready wizard with polished desktop and mobile experiences, validated by 10-15 beta users.
