# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The AI Discovery Wizard pioneers a "next-level familiar" interaction paradigm that pushes beyond traditional web forms while maintaining intuitive usability. The experience combines conversational AI intelligence with familiar form-based interactions, creating a memorable product that demonstrates AI capability through flawless execution. The interface should feel like a knowledgeable consultant guiding the user through discovery—proactive, transparent, and confidence-building—rather than a static questionnaire extracting information.

**Design Philosophy:**

- **Proof Through Experience**: The wizard itself proves AI's value; if the discovery is intelligent and delightful, it reinforces adoption confidence
- **Transparent Intelligence**: Show AI reasoning contextually (business calculations, opportunity analysis) rather than hiding behind loading spinners
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity gradually based on user engagement
- **Immediate Value**: Provide insights early in the flow to maintain engagement and demonstrate worth
- **Trust Through Clarity**: No dark patterns, no gatekeeping information, radical transparency in pricing and capabilities

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**1. Reverse Discovery Pattern**: AI suggests first (educated recommendations based on context), then user refines. This inverts traditional "blank slate" forms where users must know what to ask for. The system acts as an expert advisor proposing a starting point.

**2. Visual Workflow Sketcher**: Interactive canvas where automation opportunities appear as draggable/modifiable cards or blocks. Users can add, remove, reorder, or configure automations with direct manipulation—similar to Figma/Miro fluidity but optimized for mobile touch and desktop mouse interactions.

**3. Contextual Intelligence Display**: Throughout the wizard, replace generic loading messages with relevant business analysis. Example: Instead of "Analyzing your workflow...", show "5 paralegals × 2hrs/day intake = 50hrs/week automation opportunity." This transforms wait time into educational value.

**4. Persistent Pricing Panel**: Once automations are identified, pricing stays visible in a fixed panel (desktop sidebar or mobile bottom sheet) that updates in real-time (<500ms) as users modify selections. ROI metrics (time saved, cost per hour saved) displayed alongside pricing for immediate cost-benefit analysis.

**5. Adaptive Complexity**: Desktop experience offers full 10-15 minute deep dive with rich interactions. Mobile provides streamlined 5-minute core flow optimized for thumb navigation. Seamless handoff between devices via save/resume functionality.

**6. Conversational Form Hybrid**: Questions feel conversational (natural language, adaptive branching) but use form controls (dropdowns, sliders, multi-select) for efficiency. Avoid pure chat interface (slow, unpredictable) while maintaining human tone.

## Core Screens and Views

**Landing Page**: Hero section with clear value proposition ("Discover what AI can do for your business in 10 minutes—with transparent pricing"), time commitment badge, social proof elements, and prominent "Check if AI can be useful for me" CTA.

**Context Gathering Flow**: Progressive question sequence (3-5 screens) with visual progress bar, back/forward navigation, and auto-save indicators. Questions adapt based on previous answers (industry-specific follow-ups).

**AI Analysis Interstitial**: Brief transition screen (2-3 seconds) showing contextual insights being generated. Display actual business metrics calculations rather than generic loading animation.

**Workflow Sketcher View**: Central workspace displaying 3-7 AI-suggested automation cards arranged visually. Persistent pricing panel on side/bottom. Clear affordances for add/remove/modify actions. Each card shows: automation name, description, time savings estimate, and individual cost contribution.

**Refinement Interface**: Ability to explore additional automations (browsable library organized by category), adjust automation parameters (frequency, complexity), and see immediate pricing/savings impact.

**Summary Screen**: Professional output showing: problems identified (user pain points), proposed solutions (selected automations), time savings breakdown (weekly/monthly hours), cost estimate with transparent margin, and clear CTAs (Download PDF, Book Call).

**Email Capture Modal**: Value-first messaging ("Receive your personalized AI automation plan as a shareable PDF"), single email field, privacy assurance, and immediate PDF delivery confirmation.

**Booking Confirmation**: Calendar integration with pre-filled agenda based on discovery answers (e.g., "Discuss contract review automation for real estate closings, estimated $2,400/month, 35hrs/month saved").

## Accessibility

**WCAG AA Compliance**: Target WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for MVP to ensure usability for users with disabilities. Key considerations:

- Color contrast ratios of 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatible semantic HTML
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Alt text for images and icons
- Form labels and error messages properly associated

**Future Consideration**: Full WCAG AAA compliance post-MVP if enterprise clients require it.

## Branding

**Visual Identity**: Modern, professional, trustworthy aesthetic that appeals to small business owners in professional services. Avoid overly technical/engineer-focused design. Inspiration: Linear's polish + Stripe's clarity + Notion's approachability.

**Tone**: Confident but not arrogant, educational but not condescending, innovative but not alienating. Written content uses plain language, avoids jargon, explains AI concepts through concrete business examples.

**Differentiation**: The "workflow sketcher" visual representation and contextual intelligence displays should be distinctive enough to generate social sharing and word-of-mouth ("Have you tried that AI wizard that shows you exactly how much time you'll save?").

## Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** (desktop-first, mobile-optimized):

- Desktop experience: Full-featured 10-15 minute workflow (1024px+ viewports)
- Tablet experience: Adapted desktop experience with touch-optimized controls (768px-1023px)
- Mobile experience: Streamlined 5-minute lite version with session continuation option (375px-767px)

**Browser Support**:

- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

**Mobile OS Support**:

- iOS 14+ (Safari mobile)
- Android 10+ (Chrome mobile)

**No Native Apps**: Web-only for MVP to minimize development complexity and deployment overhead. Progressive Web App (PWA) features considered post-MVP if mobile usage exceeds 40%.
